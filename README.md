# The Impact of E-Commerce on China's Rural Poverty 
This is the R code for my NYU senior honor research thesis ‚ÄúThe Impact of E-Commerce on China‚Äôs Rural Poverty‚Äù. This paper investigates the impact of E-Commerce on China‚Äôs rural poverty using Taobao villages as a measurement of rural E-commerce development. This research is featured in the 2022 NYU Inquiry: A Journal of Undergraduate Research and is presented at the 48th NYU CAS Annual Undergraduate Research Conference.

My main research design is a two-way fixed effect panel data regression. I analyze the change of poverty over time in counties with Taobao villages compared to counties without Taobao villages. I use two samples of time. The first sample includes observations of 2014, 2016 and 2021. The second sample includes observations of 2014 and 2021. During 2014 and 2021, significant changes on Taobao villages and GDP per-capita occurred. Using samples from these two years show the medium run effect. Adding samples from 2016 would calculate both the short run effects between 2015 and 2016 and short run effects between 2016 and 2021 besides the medium run effect. I also analyze the change of poverty over time in relatively poorer counties with Taobao villages compared to relatively richer counties with Taobao villages. I use two samples. The first one includes observations with GDP per-capita below the medium GDP per capita in 2014. The second one includes observations with GDP per-capita above the medium GDP per capita in 2014.

The county and year two-way fixed effects help to control unobserved time invariant county specific variables. It helps to eliminate some selection bias that exists in naive comparison. For instance, the counties with Taobao villages may already have better infrastructure and higher per-capita GDP before they even have Taobao villages. As a result, they may have less poverty than counties without Taobao villages due to factors other than E-commerce. Using two-way fixed effects enables me to focus on change of per-capita GDP in the same county. 

My main regression model: 

Yct=Œ± + Œ≤1Taobaoct + Œ≤2 Pct + ùõæc + ùõæt +e

Yct: Outcome variables. GDP per capita for county c in year t / Share of secondary industry in GDP for county c in year t.

Taobaoct: %  of Taobao villages for county c in year t

Pct:  Population for county c in year t

Œ±: constant or intercept

Œ≤1: intercept, the impact of 1% increase of Taobao villages on county level GDP per capita/share of secondary industry in GDP 

Œ≤2 : intercept, the impact of 1% increase of population on county level GDP per capita/share of secondary industry in GDP 

c: county

t: year

ùõæc: county fixed effect 

ùõæt:  year fixed effect

e: error term

The regression model analyzes the effect of Taobao villages on county level per-capita GDP or the share of secondary industry in GDP controlling county and year fixed effect and population. Considering village-level data are lacking in China, I use county level data in my research. In this research, my treatment variable is the % of Taobao villages at county level. My outcome variable is regional poverty at county level. My unit of analysis is county. 

For my treatment data, I get Taobao village yearly entrance from Ali Annual Research Report on China Taobao Villages (2014-2021) and the complete provinces and counties list from China‚Äôs National Administration Statistics. Using these two data sources, I calculate the yearly % of Taobao villages for each county from 2014 to 2021. Noticeably, ‚ÄúTaobao village‚Äù is not a policy treatment but a result of both spontaneous and government supported rural E-Commerce development. Becoming a Taobao village does not necessarily mean the village is being specifically targeted by government policy or company program to become a Taobao village. Taobao village is used only as a measurement method in this paper.

For my outcome data, I get the per capita GDP on counties level and % of secondary industries in GDP on counties level from China County Statistical YearBook and National Bureau of Statistics (2014-2021). Per-capita GDP demonstrates economic performances and is a measure of average living standards. It indicates the regional poverty level. Secondary industry is a mechanism to help us understand how local economic activities and structures are transformed.

There are several confounders for this experiment, including location, industry type, education, infrastructure, and culture. The most important observable confounders in this research would be the location of the counties that have Taobao villages and education level of people in these counties, and the unobservable confounder may be culture. The counties that have Taobao villages may be located closer to some natural resources and may have higher per-capita GDP. They may have higher education levels and may have higher per-capita GDP. They may also have a culture with higher working ethics and may have higher per-capita GDP. These confounders lead the naive comparison to overestimate the average treatment effect, and I will control these confounders in my research. I get data sources of these confounders from China County Statistical Yearbook (2014-2021).
